START VOLLEYBALL MANAGER
The Volleyball Manager consists of two parts: the
server and the administrator client. The server 
saves all data. For that reason it have to be 
started always before the administrator
application can be started.

Click on the server icon on your desktop or in
your start menu. Now a black window appears in 
which the server is started. Wait until no 
further changes appear in the window. Depending
on the speed of your computer the start will
take between 10 and 30 seconds.

2 START THE ADMINSTRATOR CLIENT
After starting the server you can open the
administrator client. To do so click on the
icon on the desktop or select start the
Administrator in the Windows [start] menu.
